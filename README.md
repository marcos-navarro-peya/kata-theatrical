# Theatrical Players Refactoring Kata

The first chapter of ['Refactoring' by Martin Fowler, 2nd Edition](https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/refactoring2) contains a worked example of this exercise, in javascript. That chapter is available to download for free. This repo contains the starting point for this exercise in several languages, with tests, so you can try it out for yourself.

customers “volume credits” which they can use for discounts on future performances—think of it as a customer loyalty mechanism.

The players are looking to perform more kinds of plays: they hope to add history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, and poem unlimited to their repertoire.
They haven’t exactly decided yet what they want to do and when. 
This change will affect both the way their plays are charged for and the way volume credits are calculated.

### 2nd Iteration

The company is concerned about enviromental impact of their business and decided to implement an integration with a new service
that provide digital invoice for their customers. To connect to that service we need to create a Invoice
